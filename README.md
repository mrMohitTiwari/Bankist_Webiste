## Smooth Scrolling

The Bankist website utilizes smooth scrolling to create a seamless navigation experience for users. Scrolling between sections or anchors within the page will be smooth and animated, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Event Delegation

Event delegation is implemented throughout the website to handle dynamic content efficiently. Instead of attaching event listeners to individual elements, the Bankist website uses event delegation to capture events at a higher level in the DOM tree. This approach reduces memory consumption and ensures that event listeners are only set up once, even for elements that may be added or removed dynamically.

## Intersection API

The Intersection API is employed to trigger animations and actions as elements come into view during scrolling. This allows for the implementation of captivating effects and ensures that animations are executed precisely when elements become visible to the user.

## Transition Effects

During scrolling interactions, the Bankist website employs transition effects to enhance the visual appeal. These transition effects provide smooth animations, creating a more engaging and polished user experience.
